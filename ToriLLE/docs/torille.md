## ToribashControl

Main class which controls Toribash process and handles communication.

#### `__init__(settings=None, draw_game=False, executable=constants.TORIBASH_EXE, port=constants.PORT)`
Creates a new Toribash controller, but does not launch Toribash instance. 
`ToribashControl` instance can be serialized (pickled) at this point.

Parameters:
* settings: `ToribashSettings` used to define initial settings of the game. 
* draw_game: Boolean specifying if game should be human-"enjoyable", i.e. run at convenient frame-rate and display characters
* executable: String which specifies path to the game executable (toribash.exe). By default this assumes Toribash binary is in 
  `toribash` directory next to `torille.py`, which is the case is installed via pip.
* port: Integer which specifies port where Toribash Lua attempts to connect to.

#### `init()`
Launches Toribash instance and begins to control it. Uses `FileLock` to prevent multiple parallel instances from
mixing Toribash instances with each other.

ToribashControl object is **not** serializable after calling this.

#### `close()`
Closes the connection with Toribash and kills the process. Can be called at any point after `init()`

#### `get_state()`
Returns current state of the game as a `ToribashState` object.

Throws exceptions if game has not been initialized, connection is broken or connection times out.

**Note:** This function can't be called twice in row: It has to be followed by `make_actions()` or `reset()`

Returns:
* state: `ToribashState` of the current state of the game
* terminal: Boolean indicating if state was terminal 

#### `make_actions(actions)`
Sends given actions to Toribash and proceeds the game by set amount of frames (given in settings).

Throws exceptions if game has not been initialized, connection is broken/times out or actions are wrong.

**Note:** This function can't be called twice in row: It has to be followed by `get_state()` or `reset()`

Parameters:
* actions: List of two lists with `constants.NUM_CONTROLLABLES` elements.
  Each element is integer from range {1,2,3,4}. 
  These represent joint states for both Toribash characters. 
  **Note: ** Toribash character hands only take {0,1}, but for simplicity controller maps
             {1,2} => 0 and {3,4} => 4. 

#### `reset(settings=None)`
Resets the game to initial state, sets new settings (if given) and returns initial state. 

**Note:** Must be followed by `get_state()` which returned `terminal=True`.

Parameters:
* settings: `ToribashSettings` used to define initial settings of the game. 

Returns
* state: `ToribashState` of the initial state of the game

#### `validate_actions(actions)`
Used to validate actions internally to avoid Toribash crashing without errors. 

Throws an exception if action is invalid.

Parameters:
* actions: List of two lists with `constants.NUM_CONTROLLABLES` integers.

#### `finish_game()`
Finishes the current game by playing dummy actions until terminal state.

NOTE: This has to be after `get_state()`

#### `read_replay(replay_file)`
Reads a replay file and runs it through Toribash, returning list of `ToribashState`s
for each **frame** in the replay.

Parameters:
* replay_file: Path to replay file to be read inside Toribash replay directory "replay"

Returns:
* states: List of `ToribashState`s, one for each frame in the replay

#### `get_state_dim()`
Returns number of variables in state per player

Returns:
* state_dim: Number of elements in state vector per player

#### `get_num_joints()`
Returns number of joints per player (number of controllables)

Returns:
* action_dim: Number of joints per player

#### `get_num_joint_states()`
Returns number of states a joint can be in 

Returns:
* action_categories: Number of states joint can be in

## ToribashState

Class used to refine and represent state
from Toribash. Returned by `ToribashControl.get_state()` and `ToribashControl.reset()`. 

#### `limb_positions`
A Numpy array of shape (2, `constants.NUM_LIMBS`, 3) containing positions of 
body parts of both players.

#### `limb_velocities`
A Numpy array of shape (2, `constants.NUM_LIMBS`, 3) containing velocities of 
body parts of both players.

#### `groin_rotations`
A Numpy array of shape (2, 4, 4) containing the rotation matrix of the groin (hip) 
of both players.

#### `joint_states`
A Numpy array of shape (2, `constants.NUM_CONTROLLABLES`) containing current
states of the joints of both players

#### `injuries`
A Numpy array of shape (2,) containing current injury of both players (value seen
in game at the top-left and top-right.)

#### `winner`
A single integer or None, specifying the winner of the game.
Only defined at the end of the game (state which was received at terminal state).
0 = game was tie. 1 = player 1 won. 2 = player 2 won. None = Game didn't end.

#### `selected_player`
0 or 1, indicating which of the players is currently active.
This is fixed in multiplayer game, and local player can be either one.

#### `match_length`, `match_frame`, `frames_next_turn`
Length of the game (in frames), number of frames played already and
how many frames next turn will last.

#### `get_normalized_locations()`
Returns a (2, 2, NUM_LIMBS, 3) array, representing location of both players' 
body parts, with respect to both players (first dimension).

The locations are centered around respective players' groin (close to hip), and
rotated according to groin's rotation. E.g. at the start of the game, both
players will have exactly the same coordinates for their and their opponent's 
body parts.

## ToribashSettings

Class used to represent and contain rules for Toribash. These can be used
to modify the game's mechanics.

**Note:** New settings can only be applied at `ToribashControl.reset(settings)`.

**Note2:** If `custom_settings` is enabled, the game will set all the following settings
to provided values. **This will override any settings from any loaded mod!**.

#### `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` (class-variable)
OrderedDict defining the default settings of Toribash game:

#### Possible settings

Name | Description | Type | Default
---- | ----------- | ---- | -------
custom_settings | If following custom settings should be applied | {0,1} | 1 |
matchframes | Length of an episode in frames | Integer | 500|
turnframes | Number of frames per turn (aka frame-skip) | Integer (interval [1,matchframes]) | 10| 
engagement_distance | Starting distance between characters | Integer | 100|
engagement_height | Starting height of characters | Integer  | 0|
engagement_rotation | Starting rotation (degrees, anti-clockwise) of characters | Integer | 0|
gravity_x | Strength of gravity in X axis | Float | 0.0|
gravity_y | Strength of gravity in Y axis | Float | 0.0|
gravity_z | Strength of gravity in Z axis | Float | -9.81|
damage | Is damaging enabled | {0,1} | 0 |
dismemberment_enable | Is dismemberment enabled | {0,1} | 1|
dismemberment_threshold | Force required to dismemberment to happen | Integer | 100|

disqualification_enabled | Enable disqualification (see link below for more info) | {0,1} | 0| 
disqualification_flags | Settings for disqualification (see link below for more info) | Integer | 0 |
disqualification_timeout | How long one can touch ground before disqualified | Integer | 0|
dojo_type | How battle arena works (see link below for more info) | Integer | 0|
dojo_size | How large the arena is | Integer | 0|
replay_file | If not equal to "None", Toribash will save replay of the played episode in `replay/[replay_file]` at end of the episode | String | "None"
mod | Game mod to be played. Above settings will override mod's settings if `custom_settings` = 1 | String | "classic"


See [this](http://forum.toribash.com/showthread.php?t=317900) Toribash topic for more info on settings.

#### `__init__(**kwargs)`
Creates new `ToribashSettings` object using `ToribashSettings.DEFAULT_SETTINGS` as a base
and overriding values based on `kwargs`.

Parameters:
* kwargs: Keyword arguments used to override default settings. See keys in `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`.
          E.g. `ToribashSettings(matchframes=1000)` creates new settings object where match length
               is set to 1000 frames, rather than default 500.

#### `get(key)`
Return the value of given setting name.

Parameters:
* key: String of the setting name.

Returns:
* value: Value of the setting given

#### `set(key,value)`
Set given setting to a given value.

Parameters:
* key: String of the setting name.
* value: Value of the setting

#### `validate_settings()`
Used internally to validate settings (correct type, no illegal characters (",") in strings).

Throws errors and warnings accordingly.
