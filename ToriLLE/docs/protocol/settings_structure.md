Elements in the action list ([index] = [description]).
```
0 = custom_settings (bool, {0,1}, if following settings should be applied)
1 = matchframes (int, game default: 500. How long the match is in terms of frames)
2 = turnframes (int from interval [1,matchframes], game default: 10. How many frames each action is repeated for (in DRL, this would be "frame skip"/"action repeat"))
3 = engagement distance (int, game default: 100. Starting distance between players)
4 = engagement height (int, game default: 0. Starting height of players)
5 = engagement rotation (int, game default: 0. Starting rotation of players (in deg))
6 = gravity (float3, x,y,z, game default: 0.0 0.0 -9.81. Direction of gravity)
9 = damage (int, one of {0,1,2}, game default: 0. See source below for further info)
10 = dismemberment (bool, {0,1}, game default: 1. Enable/disable dismemberment)
11 = dismemberthreshold  (int, game default: 100. How much power is needed to rip joints off)
12 = fractures (bool, {0,1}, game default: 0. Enable/disable fractures)
13 = fracturethreshold  (int, game default: 100. How much power is needed for fracturing a joint)
14 = disqualification (bool, {0,1}, game default: 0. Enable/disable disqualification)
15 = disqual flags (bool, {0,1}, game default: 0. See source for more info)
16 = disqual timeout (int, game default: 0. Number of frames one can touch ground before loosing)
17 = dojotype (bool, {0,1}, game default: 0, Type of the dojo (square or round))
18 = dojosize (int, game default: 0, Size of the dojo)
19 = replay_file (str, default: "None", Replay file where to store rounds (only stored if doesn't match with string "None"))
20 = mod (str, default: "classic", Name of the mod to be played. Note that settings above override mod's settings if custom_settings is 1)
20 = replayed_file (str, default: "None", Name of the replay file to be played. If set, this will override other settings and load a replay instead)
```

Floats have decimals separated with dot ".".
